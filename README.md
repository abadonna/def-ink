# defold-ink

The [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) language runtime implementation in Lua, an alternative to [Narrator](https://github.com/astrochili/narrator),  based on parsing [ink JSON](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/ink_JSON_runtime_format.md) files. 

## Version
Works with Inky 0.14.1/ink v.1.1.1

Please note: json ink format sometimes changes, so check your version.

## Example
```lua
local ink = require "ink.story"

-- Parse a story from the JSON file. Make sure it's UTF8!
local res = sys.load_resource("/assets/test.json")
local story = ink.create(res)

-- Begin the story
local paragraphs, answers = story.continue()

-- Output text to the player
for _, p in ipairs (paragraphs) do
	pprint(p.text)
end

if #answers > 0 then
	for i, a in ipairs (answers) do
		pprint("[" .. i .. "] " .. a.text)
	end
end

 -- Send answer #1 to the story to generate new paragraphs
paragraphs, answers = story.continue(1)

```
### Defold
You can use defold-ink in your own project by adding it as a Defold library [dependency](http://www.defold.com/manuals/libraries/). Open your game.project file and in the dependencies field under project add:

```
https://github.com/abadonna/defold-ink/archive/master.zip

```

Then you can require the ```ink.story``` module.

Alternatively - try this [defold project template](https://github.com/abadonna/text-adventure-template) that provides a good start for creating game with Ink and Defold.

## Documentation
### create(json)
Parses the Ink json string and returns a story instance. Make sure it's UTF8!
```lua
local ink = require "ink.story"
local res = sys.load_resource("/assets/test.json")
local story = ink.create(res)
```

### story.continue(answer_index)
Returns paragraphs and choices. Parameter "answer_index" is ignored if the story just begins.
```lua
local paragraphs, choices = story.continue(1)

```

### story.add_observer(var_name, f)
Assigns an observer function to the global variable. Each global variable can have multiple observers.


### story.remove_observer(var_name, f)
Removes an observer function.


### story.assign_value(name, value)
Assigns value to global variable and calls all it's observers.


### story.variables
Just a table of all global variables you can read and set. Use **story.assign_value(name, value)** to notify observer functions about the change.


### story.eval(expression)
Returns a result of evaluation of string expression, all names of global variables will be replaced by values.


## Saving and loading
Story actually replays from the start with saved user choices, similar to what you see in Inky editor while modifiyng ink script. But it happens more correct way - as we keep random values as well.

### story.get_state()
Returns the current state of the story. Can be saved and used to restore story later.
```lua
local filename = sys.get_save_file("inktest", "story")
sys.save(filename, story.get_state())

```

### story.restore(state, with_externals)
Restores story from the saved state. Story should be created with the same - or at least similar :) - json.
Returns it's last paragraphs and choices. Set parameter "with_externals" to true if you want external functions to be called during restoring, e.g. you have some calculations in lua code. 
```lua
local story = ink.create(json_string)
local paragraphs, choices = story.restore(state)

```



## Multiple parallel flows
It is possible to have multiple parallel "flows" - please read [this](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/RunningYourInk.md#multiple-parallel-flows-beta) for more details.

### story.switch_flow(name)
Creates a new flow or switches to an existing one. If name is nil - it will goes back to the default flow.

### story.jump(path)
You can jump to a particular named knot or stitch.
